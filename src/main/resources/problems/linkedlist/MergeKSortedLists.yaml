  Return the sorted linked list that is the result of merging all of the individual linked lists.

  Example 1:

  Input: lists = [[1,2,4],[1,3,5],[3,6]]

  Output: [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
  Example 2:

  Input: lists = []

  Output: []
  Example 3:

  Input: lists = [[]]

  Output: []
  Constraints:

  0 <= lists.length <= 1000
  0 <= lists[i].length <= 100
  -1000 <= lists[i][j] <= 1000
