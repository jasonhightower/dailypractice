name: KokoEatingBananas
description: |
  You are given an integer array `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of bananas in the `ith` pile. You are also
  given an integer `h`, which represents the number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.

  You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate of `k`. Each hour, you may choose a pile of bananas and
  Koko eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, you may finish eating the pile but you can
  not eat another pile in the same hour.

  Return the minimum integer `k` such that you can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.
