name: "ValidPalindrome"
description: |
  Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.
  
  A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all
  non-alphanumeric characters.
  
  Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters `(A-Z, a-z)` and numbers `(0-9)`.
