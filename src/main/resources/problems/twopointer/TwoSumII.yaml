  Given an array of integers `numbers` that is sorted in non-descending order and a target `integer` `k`.
  
  Return the indices of (1-indexed) of two numbers, `[index1, index2]`, such that they add up to a given target
  number `target` and `index < index2`. Note that `index1` and `index2` cannot be equal, therefor you may not
  use the same element twice.
  
  There will always be exactly one valid solution.
  
  Your solution must use O(1) additional space.
