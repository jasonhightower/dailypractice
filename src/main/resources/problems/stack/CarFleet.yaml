name: CarFleet
description: |
  There are `n` cars travelling to the same destination on a one-lange highway.
  
  You are given two arrays of integers `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`.
  * `position[i]` is the position of the `ith car` (in miles)
  * `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour)
  
  The destination is at position `target` miles.
  
  A car can not pass another car ahead of it. It can only catch up to another car and then drive at the same speed
  as the car ahead of it.
  
  A car fleet is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. A single car is also
  considered a car fleet.
  
  If a car catches up to a car fleet the moment the fleet reaches the destination, then the car is considered to be
  part of the fleet.
  
  Return the number of different car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
