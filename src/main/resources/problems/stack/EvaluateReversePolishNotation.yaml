name: EvaluateReversePolishNotation
description: |
  You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents a valid arithmetic expression in reverse polish notation.
  
  Return the integer that represents the evaluation of the expression.
  
  * The operands may be integers or the results of other operations.
  * the operators include `+`,`-`,`*`, and `/`.
  * Assume that division between integers always truncates toward zero.
  
  Example 1:

  Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
  Output: 9
  Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
  Example 2:

  Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
  Example 3:

  Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
  Output: 22
  Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
    = (0 + 17) + 5
    = 17 + 5
    = 22
